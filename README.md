# Gender Diversity Analysis

In 2021 Canada became the first country to collect and publish data on gender diversity from a national census. 

This repo contains R and Python code to recreate a plot from the [StatCan daily](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/220427/dq220427b-eng.htm) concerning gender diversity in Canada.

The R version uses `ggplot2` and the python uses `plotly`.
